📚 Learnings & Key Takeaways
This project provided hands-on exposure to both machine learning engineering and practical deployment. Some of the key learnings include:

End-to-End ML Lifecycle: Understanding the full process from EDA → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → deployment.

Deep Learning for Tabular Data: Applying ANN architectures to structured datasets and comparing results with traditional ML models.

Feature Engineering & Scaling: Importance of preprocessing (encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, handling imbalance).

Model Evaluation Beyond Accuracy: Why ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices matter for churn problems.

Explainability with SHAP: Gained insights into how features like tenure, subscription type, and monthly charges impact churn.

Deployment Skills: Learned how to deploy ML models as interactive dashboards using Streamlit Cloud, making them accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

These takeaways reflect real-world data science workflows and strengthen skills in building industry-ready AI applications.
